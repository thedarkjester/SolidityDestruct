# SolidityDestruct

Test this yourself - try each of the steps in the 'Killer' contract

Interesting interactions:
- only one of these will actually execute and sent the ETH back (see Dangerous comment)
- sometimes the function stops executing (the working one, when calling the other calls - maybe remix) - but only 1 option works
